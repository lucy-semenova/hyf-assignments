Reflection

I. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
 
 1. It took minimum time to create Minimal HTML5 boilerplate using Copilot agent. I intentionally completed almost all teh tasks using AI.
 2. The comparison between Internal CSS, External CSS, Inline CSS, their pros and cons.
 3. The solution to how to change the background depending on the size of device was so simple and nice. AI helped me providing the information on the fonts that are highly readable, modern and blog-friendly, it also suggests combination for body and heading.
 4. Difference between const and let. As I am a complete beginner in JavaScript, I found the video on how to make the background be randomly changed when the button is clicked. I copied the code form the video, checked if it worked and asked  Copilot to explain the code step by step. Then I asked it to improve the text and found out that const is a better choice to be used. 

Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?
The common reason I had to tweak Copilot was because of its desire to make things more complex and grandeur. As for the explanations I also often asked for three types of explanations (for a 5 year old kid, for a complete beginner and an experienced front-end developer).

How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
While the code being generated we get the work done for us,  when we ask questions and specify the unclear moments, we keep the code under control, can develop our skills and avoid mistakes, otherwise we stagnate or even worse.

Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
- not learning;
- making errors we cannot notice and understand;
- wasting time instead of developing;
