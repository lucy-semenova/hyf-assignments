         <h2>Italy</h2>
      <p> Our Italian adventure began in the charming city of <b>Bergamo</b>, a hidden gem with cobblestone streets and the aroma of freshly baked focaccia drifting through the air. We rode the historic funicular up to the Città Alta, the old town, where every alley revealed stunning architecture, lively piazzas, and the soulful sounds of street musicians playing Vivaldi’s Summer.</p>

      <p>From there, we made our way to <b>Milan</b>, the heartbeat of Italian fashion, where every street felt like a runway and every café served espresso with effortless elegance. We wandered through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, marveling at high-end boutiques and elegant façades, and visited iconic landmarks like the Duomo. Milan’s mix of history, contemporary design, and culinary delights — from creamy risotto alla Milanese to indulgent gelato — made it impossible not to fall in love with the city.  </p>
              <p>The journey continued to <b>Venice</b>, a city that felt like stepping into a painting — its winding canals, ornate bridges, and timeless beauty were simply unforgettable. We took a day to visit the nearby islands of <b>Murano</b> and <b>Burano</b>, where we witnessed master artisans at glass workshops, shaping delicate masterpieces that seemed almost magical, and wandered past the rainbow-hued houses of Burano, famous for their lacework. Sampling fresh seafood by the canal, listening to gondoliers sing, and breathing in the salty lagoon air made every moment feel enchanting.</p>
                <p>Italy stole our hearts with its perfect mix of taste, style, and artistry — from the vibrant energy and music of Bergamo’s old town, to Milan’s fashion streets and refined cuisine, to Venice’s canals, Murano’s glass masterpieces, and Burano’s colorful charm. Every stop was a feast for the senses, leaving us with memories we’ll treasure forever.</p>
